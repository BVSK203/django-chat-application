# Real-time Django Chat Application with Channels, WebSockets, jQuery, and Templates

This is a simple **real-time chat application** built using **Django**, **Django Channels**, **WebSockets**, **jQuery**, and **CSS**. The app allows users to send and receive messages in real time. It is structured with basic HTML templates and jQuery to ensure smooth user interaction.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly via WebSockets.
- **Basic Chat Room**: A simple chat room where multiple users can communicate in real-time.
- **User Authentication (Basic)**: The app uses Django's default authentication system, where users can log in and log out.
- **Multiple Users**: Logging out one user will not affect other users who are still logged in.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Redis (for WebSocket message handling)
- Node.js (for frontend dependencies if needed)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BVSK203/django-chat-application.git
cd django-chat-application
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the database migrations to set up your Django application:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create Superuser (For Admin Access)

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create a superuser.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 7. Frontend Setup

If you are using jQuery or have custom frontend templates, include them in the HTML files (more details below).

### 8. Test the Application

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.
2. Log in using your superuser credentials or create a new user.
3. You should see a simple chat room interface, and be able to send and receive messages in real time.

## How It Works

### **Real-Time Communication with Django Channels and WebSockets**

- **WebSockets** enable real-time communication between the server and the client, ensuring that messages are instantly delivered to all users in the chat room.
- **Django Channels** handle the WebSocket connection, enabling Django to support asynchronous communication.

### **Basic Chat Room Page**

We will create a simple HTML boilerplate with the following structure:

- **Chat interface**
- **Send and receive messages**
- **Basic user logout functionality**

### Troubleshooting

- Check your WebSocket URL paths and make sure they are correctly defined in your routing and views.
